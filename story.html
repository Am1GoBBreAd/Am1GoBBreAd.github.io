      V is a Haywood-born street gangster who went to Atlanta several years ago, but returned to the City of Night because of her hometown. Jack also became V's only best friend in the City of Night. The two become more and more famous and succeed in attracting the attention of Dexter DeSean, a Haywood middleman, who is asked by his spouse, Evelyn Parker, to steal Yorishige Arazaka's treasure hidden in the Kombi building - a personality chip called Relic. V and Jack gladly accept. With the help of the hacker T-bug, V and Jack find the secret safe in the penthouse suite of the Kombi building through Evelyn's super dream, and raid the territory of the Whirlpool Gang to get the military hacker robot "Little Flathead". The two of them had to hide behind a huge screen in the living room of the suite to watch the situation. He finds out that his youngest son has stolen the Relic. After sending away their personal guards, Adam Shigehammer and Goro Takemura, Saburo loudly scolds Yorisuan for betraying him. After Saburo's death, the Kombi building monitors the disappearance of Saburo's vital signs and immediately contacts the trauma team, and the building is closed. Trapped on the top floor of the Kombi building, V and Jack decide to escape from the outer wall through T-bug's command. Immediately afterwards, T-bug is also exposed to the AraZaka intranet overtime and is burned to death by the prosthetic body implanted by the AraZaka hackers, and under the strafing of the NCPD floating vehicle, Jack is accidentally shot and the sterile container loaded with Relic chips is broken. Jack, in order to protect V's safety and to successfully complete the mission, resolutely plugged the Relic chip into his own brain-computer interface and insisted on using his last breath to kill with V out of the Kombi building, then the two of them escaped to the AI cab Draman prepared by De Shawn beforehand and sped towards the Haywood area under the protection of Draman. During the period, Jack died of his wounds and passed away peacefully after entrusting Relic and his dream of becoming a legend in the City of Night to V. V could only hold back his grief and anger and let Draman carry Jack's body back to Haywood, and went alone to negotiate with Deshawn. V was shot in the head and died of brain death. V was shot in the head, went brain dead, and was dumped by De Shawn in a garbage dump on the outskirts of Night City. However, the brain-dead V was judged by Relic to be a suitable prosthetic body and began to execute the body appropriation protocol, quickly repairing V's brain damage and in the meantime successfully copying the Johnny Silverhand consciousness body carried in the chip to V's brain. Two days later, V woke up in the junkyard and saw Goro Takemura and De Shawn in a trance, who tried to take credit for V's corpse to Arasaka, but the former killed him on the spot. The latter tried to take credit for V's body to Arazaka, but was killed on the spot by the former. Goro Takemura found out that V was not dead, and adhering to his credo of being responsible for Saburo Arazaka to the death, he reported the matter to Yorozumi Arazaka, who was worried that his father's murder would be exposed. The restoration process continues and it takes V 8 hours to regain his senses. The first thing he does after coming to his senses is to escape from the Arazaka ninjas with Takemura, and they escape from death. With the help of Haywood prosthetic doctor V, V regained his health, but was also told by V that the Relic chip was taking away his life and that his time was up. Takemura then parted from V and searched for a solution to the problem alone.

      As the Relic encroachment process starts, visions of the Silver Hand begin to appear uncontrollably in front of V's eyes, and memories of the Silver Hand begin to appear in her mind. As her body heals, the Silver Hand in her mind gradually materializes, and can even begin to interact directly with V. The Silver Hand is very aggressive and directly states that it is V's body that it craves, hoping to use V to achieve the revenge it failed to accomplish 50 years ago. V also understands that this Cyber zealot living in his head is a very dangerous thing, and will never give Silverhand a life that he has fought so hard to get back. But the unity of purpose between the two still allowed them to reach a brief united front in V's body. They both needed to figure out what the Relic chip really was and why Evelyn Parker, a sex doll, knew the top secrets of AraZaka. After a short break, Goro Takemura contacts V. After the meeting, Takemura says that he needs V's help to make Yorozawa pay for what he has done, and in exchange for a quid pro quo, he provides V with the name of the person in charge of Arazaka's Relic project - Herman. V accepts the deal, and although Silverhand keeps pushing behind her back, she manages to sort out two threads in the mess: one, find the Hermann that Takemura is talking about and ask him about the Relic chip; two, find Evelyn. Second, find Evelyn Parker to see if she can uncover the forces hiding behind the curtain. The former she needs the help of Silverhand's former concubine and Queen of the Night City, Logue, while the latter she has to go to the chassis of the Mox Gang to find Evelyn Parker's best friend - Judy Alvarez.V decided to start with Herman, who had spearheaded the development of the Relic chip, so he must have a way to get it out. The company's main goal is to get the best out of the world. The company's main business is to provide a wide range of products and services to the market. It turns out that although Herman is the head of the Relic project at AraZaka, he has jumped to Contau. Contau was suppressed by Arasaka during the Fourth Corporate War, and was far smaller than its predecessor, so it attached great importance to the jumping of high-tech talent Herman, and dispatched a special person to ensure the safety of transportation. As luck would have it, the floating vehicle transporting Herman happened to pass over the outskirts of Night City shortly, and all it took was to seize the opportunity to capture Herman alive. But this operation can not be completed by V alone, she needs a helper, Rog thought for a moment and recommended to V the wanderer Panan (also my wife) - in the evil land planning a robbery, looking for the wanderer is right.

When V met Panam in the City of Night, this feisty girl was shouting at a car. After going up to her, she gave a very clear answer: she couldn't help. The two of them are in the city of the night, the girl is shouting at a car, but without the right firepower from Kang Tao's men to grab people is like asking for death. v is not hesitant to say that they will help Panan to grab back the armored car, but afterwards Panan must also help himself to catch Herman, Panan quickly agreed. The two of them set a trap in the evil earth for the chaos sword will, although the cooperation is not tacit, but still successfully robbed Panam's beloved car. Panang was so happy about this that he officially announced his partnership with V and introduced V to others in the Rangers camp, including Panang's closest relatives - Rangers leader Saul, veteran Mitch and Scorpion. While helping V develop a plan for Herman's capture, the duo's actions invite retaliation from the Gone With the Wind Society, who capture Saul and use him as a threat to the entire Rangers tribe. When Panang was at his wits' end, V stepped forward and single-handedly killed Saul to rescue him from the Gone with the Wind camp, impressing the entire Rangers tribe and deepening the friendship between Panang and V. After studying in detail the route of Kang Tao's floating car, Panan developed a special strategy - there is a power station in the path of the floating car, and the two of them only need to overload it and trigger an EMP impact, you can unwittingly crash the floating car, but also to avoid Hermann casualties, while Panan's armored car is diesel-powered, but also to ensure that the two are not affected by EMP. This was clearly the best way for V. Without saying a word, he and Panam began preparing for the operation. That night, the two of them successfully entered the power station as planned and triggered the EMP impact on time, but unexpectedly, Kang Tao's floating vehicle was already prepared for this, and only lost power for a few seconds and then successfully ignited back to mid-air, watching the floating vehicle fly farther and farther away, the operation was about to be declared a failure. Panang and V drove after it, but in the distance they found Mitch and Scorpion also driving to the scene - the two did not know about the matter, only out of the eagerness of the wanderers, not to mention that the scene waiting for them will be the security forces of Kang Tao. An anxious Panang shouts over the comm channel, but can only drown out the electronic interference stirred up by the EMP. Panang and V arrived at the scene and saved Mitch before the Contau security could execute him, but they were still too late and Scorpion had already been beaten to death by the Contau security robots. The wounded Mitch shows V and Panang where Herman is headed, and returns to the Rangers' camp for help. The two again began to chase, finally catching him before the Contau evacuation of Hermann, and with the Contau reinforcements to start a fierce fight, but two fists can not beat four hands, the two fell into a bitter battle. The key moment Saul led the Rangers arrived, the crowd successfully repelled Kang Tao security. Although the operation ended with the successful capture of Hermann alive, but Panan still fell into a deep sense of remorse, she attributed the death of the scorpion to their own recklessness, and after the incident with Sol broke out a heated argument. Despite everything, V accomplishes her first goal. That night, V questioned Herman at the Sunset Inn, and when asked if the Relic could be removed, Herman's answer left both V and Silverhand in silence: what matters is not the Relic chip itself, but the consciousness that the Relic carries, and once the chip has completed the transfer of consciousness, even if the chip is removed it does not affect the appropriation of the consciousness to the host, and once the replication is complete, it is irreversible in any case, and the host The death of the host will also result in the dissipation of the consciousness. This statement killed all hope of V's survival and made Silverhand understand that his revenge could only be accomplished by V's hand, and that they were now grasshoppers in the same boat. Hermann saw V's concern, and out of the obstinacy of a researcher, Hermann made a proposal to V - to go to Kang Tao together, hoping to find a way to reverse the situation with the best research facilities, but V refused. V, who was despondent, did not intend to take Herman's life, but contacted Goro Takemura and left him to deal with him. When he left the room, Gintoki, uncharacteristically, sat with V under the moonlight of the evil earth and calmly talked about his thoughts - since they were now sharing one life, they might as well spend the rest of their days thinking about how to live. V, who never smokes, also lit up a cigarette, she remembered that Jack died before the dream of becoming a legend with this special Relic chip entrusted to her, only to feel that everything seems to have its own destiny.

      Connected to Bridget's hacking device, V carries the silver hand smoothly into Cyberspace. Here, all devices and objects are just a string of code in the sea of data, any visible environment exists in the form of code (Matrix), V can only move forward under Bridget's guidance, Bridget explained that the voodoo gang has actually found a way to go over the black wall, but the AI outside the black wall can not meet them, only Otter has the possibility of - - in other words, only Silverhand. -In other words, only Silverhand's code can find Otter, and V is now the key to the Voodoo Gang. In front of the black wall, Bridget issued a warning to V: after stepping out of the black wall, if not able to find Otter, V's consciousness will probably remain in a void, and the body will become the walking dead. In the end, V is determined to die. Outside the black wall full of data and emptiness, Silverhand called out Otter's name, but the answer was a network monitor hacker, in the real world V may still be able to fight with a martial arts, but in Cyberspace can only sit and wait for death, in the nick of time, a huge consciousness polymer waved his hand and destroyed the entire network monitor subnet - V and Silverhand met Ott Coningham as he had hoped, things have changed, from the physical bondage of Ott has now become part of the Sea of Data, she brought the two back to the wall, Silverhand tried to communicate with them, but found that now Ott has long been out of the mortal mind, she did not avoid all that she had done before she was born, and slightly scornful look at Silverhand, and scoffed at what he had done. Silverhand was furious, but also understood that Ott Coningham had died, the consciousness polymer in front of her is just a projection of her mind, impotent rage can only plead with Ott to save V, as a return to save the life of the year. Ott did not refuse, she pointed out the way forward for V - himself as an AI no equipment can handle the complex consciousness network, V must let her access a computing power comparable to a whole city of equipment, in order to successfully complete the consciousness backup, the V and Silver Hand separation. Silverhand and V immediately thought of the gods and - Arazaka separating Otter and Silverhand consciousness of the machine. Ott did not object, Silverhand wished to say goodbye to her properly, but she was sent directly out of the network. The two returned to the real world, Bridget had been waiting for a long time. Seeing the two safe and sound, Bridget understood that Ott had returned to the wall and that the Voodoo Gang's technology had proven viable. Relic's side effects flared up again and V had to take a nap on the side of the road, while Silverhand was not saying a word, which aroused V's curiosity, and after seeing several of Silverhand's memories, V knew that Silverhand loved Ott and knew that people like Silverhand would not become so cynical just because of Ott. After a series of questions, the silver hand is not tired, he rarely speaks his mind: "I rebelled not Arabsaka, V." he said aloud, "I am not for Ott, let alone for themselves. I've seen Arazaka do more abominable things to ordinary people than they did to Otter, I've witnessed them take away water from farmers... And finally, the land, having witnessed them turn the City of Night into a machine, using people's broken spirits, broken dreams and people's money as fuel. For too long the corporations have controlled people's livelihoods and taken everything... Now even the souls are not spared. v, I declare war, not because capitalism is a thorn in my side, nor for nostalgia for the America of the past, this is a war of the people against a deranged social system, and a war against chaos, do you understand?"

     The best option is to tell the truth about Saburo Arazaka's death and hope she can help. The two of them meet at the Night City to tell the truth about his father's death. V is curious as to what Takemura is trying to sell by choosing to meet late at night, but Takemura simply says that he is waiting for someone important. In the darkness, Takemura introduces the visitor to V. The person they are waiting for is Arazaka Hwako's bodyguard and Takemura's best friend, Koda. Instead of showing any joy at seeing his old friend alive, Oda just questioned Takemura as the bodyguard of the Grand Master why he did not do his duty to his master. After the parade is over, he doesn't want to cause any trouble until then. Mindful of his friendship, Oda offers to help Takemura and V escape from Night City, but the two of them refuse without hesitation. But Takemura is still keen to catch a clue - the Japan Street parade is the only chance for Wasako to appear in public, and as long as she is not at Arasaka Tower, the security force is not a big problem. If you want to make a move in Japan Street, you have to get the support of Wako, the middleman of Japan Street. Since you are in the road, you cannot offend both the company and the underworld. When Wakako saw the two arrive, she greeted them with a smile and asked about Takemura's identity, while V got right to the point: Wakako and her Tiger Claw Gang hold the pulse of the entire City of Night, and it is impossible for her not to know who Takemura is. V, knowing that he couldn't hide it from her, explained his and Takemura's plan to rob the Sanjuro Festival mountain car, and was prepared to be rejected by Wako, but Wako just nodded and handed over the security plan and the route of the mountain car that night. The bodyguard, Takemura, had never seen such a scene, and stammered out of his mouth, "I... I don't have any money." Wako cheerfully declined Takemura's offer of payment, saying outright that the message counted as a gift and that she had taken it into consideration and gave the duo her blessing.
